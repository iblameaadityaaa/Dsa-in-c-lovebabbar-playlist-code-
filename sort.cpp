/*
BUBBLE SORTING ALGORITHM:

In Bubble Sort algorithm, 
traverse from left and compare adjacent elements and the higher one is placed at right side. 
In this way, the largest element is moved to the rightmost end at first. 
This process is then continued to find the second largest and place it and so on until the data is sorted.

Complexity Analysis of Bubble Sort:
Time Complexity: O(N2)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Advantages of Bubble Sort:
Bubble sort is easy to understand and implement.
It does not require any additional memory space.
It is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that elements with the same key value maintain their relative order in the sorted output.
requires a comparison opera
Disadvantages of Bubble Sort:
Bubble sort has a time complexity of O(N2) which makes it very slow for large data sets.
Bubble sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm,
which means that it tor to determine the relative order of elements in the input data set. It can limit the efficiency of the algorithm in certain cases.
